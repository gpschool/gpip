I will briefly describe our work on the sparse pseudo-input Gaussian
process (SPGP), where we refine the sparse approximation by selecting
`pseudo-inputs' using gradient methods. I will then describe several
extensions to this framework. Firstly we incorporate supervised
dimensionality reduction to deal with high dimensional input
spaces. Secondly we develop a version of the SPGP that can handle
input-dependent noise. These extensions allow GP methods to be applied to
a wider variety of modelling tasks than previously possible.

<p>Joint work with Zoubin Ghahramani.
