We present a novel approach to image feature and scale detection based
on the fractional Brownian image model in which images are
realisations of a Gaussian random process on the plane. Image features
are points of interest usually sparsely distributed in images. We
propose to detect such points and their intrinsic scale by detecting
points in scale-space that locally minimises the likelihood under the
model.
