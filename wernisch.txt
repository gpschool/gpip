Complex gene regulatory mechanisms ensure the proper functioning of
biological cells. New high-throughput experimental techniques, such as
microarrays, provide a snapshot of gene expression levels of thousands
of genes at the same time. If repeated on a sample of synchronized
cells, time-series profiles of gene activity can be obtained. The aim
is to reconstruct the complex gene regulatory network underlying these
profiles. Genes often influence each other in a nonlinear fashion and
with intricate interaction patterns. Linear models are often unsuited
to capture such relationships. Gaussian processes, on the other hand,
are ideal for representing nonlinear relationships. A particular
attraction is the automatic relevance determination effect, removing
unused inputs and resulting in sparse gene networks.
