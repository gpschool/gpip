The Octopus arm is a highly versatile and complex limb. How the
Octopus controls such a hyper-redundant arm (not to mention eight of
them!) is as yet unknown. Robotic arms based on the same mechanical
principles may render present day robotic arms obsolete. In this talk,
I will describe how we tackle this problem using an online
reinforcement learning algorithm, based on a Bayesian approach to
policy evaluation known as Gaussian process temporal difference (GPTD)
learning.

<p>Our substitute for the real arm is a computer simulation of a
2-dimensional model of an Octopus arm. Even with the simplifications
inherent to this model, the state space we face is a high-dimensional
one, for any arm of reasonable size. We apply a GPTD-based algorithm
to this domain, and demonstrate its operation on several learning
tasks of varying degrees of difficulty.
