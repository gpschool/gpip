Log Gaussian processes (LGP) are an attractive manner to construct
intensity surfaces for the purposes of spatial epidemiology. The
intensity surfaces are naturally smoothed by placing a GP prior over
the relative log Poisson rate. In this work a fully independent
training conditional (FITC) sparse approximation is used to speed up
GP computations. The sampling of the latent values is sped up with
transformations taking into account the approximate conditional
posterior precision.
