Inferring the concentration of transcription factors' proteins from
the expression levels of target genes is a very active area of
research in computational biology. Usually, the dynamics of the gene
expression levels are modelled using differential equations where the
transcription factor protein concentrations are treated as parameters,
subsequently estimated using MCMC. We show how this inference problem
can be solved more elegantly by placing a GP prior over the latent
functions, obtaining comparable results to the standard MCMC approach
in a fraction of the time.
