<h3> Workshop Now Over</h3>

Post-proceedings deadline for submissions is 15th September 2006. See <a

<p>There has been a recent upsurge in interest
in Gaussian processes for solving a variety of machine learning
problems. Simultaneously there have been recent rapid developments in
efficient approximation techniques for Gaussian processes and novel
unifying theories of existing approximation techniques.

<p>This workshop will bring experts in Gaussian processes together
with individuals who are using Gaussian processes at the forefront of
research in their fields. We will start with a set of talks that will
relate the latest developments in Gaussian processes (speakers include
Chris Williams, Carl Rasmussen, David MacKay and Ed Snelson) while the
second portion of talks will discuss application fields where Gaussian
processes are being applied as state-of-the-art technologies: Robotics,
Graphics and Vision (speakers include Brian Ferris, Aaron Hertzmann and
Raquel Urtasun).

<p>We expect attendees at the workshop who are expert in Gaussian
processes as well as attendees who are interested in finding out about
Gaussian processes. The workshop is expected to be an ideal entry
point to a researcher interested in using these models, but at the
same time, by bringing together acknowledged experts in Gaussian
processes with acknowledged experts in the application areas mentioned
above we expect to drive forward research in novel directions.

<p>We invite submissions to the workshop of <b>no more than four
pages</b> in length using the LaTeX article class file in one column
with standard margin settings and 11pt font. The submission deadline
is Friday May 19th. 

<p>Registration for the workshop will close on <b>Friday 26th May</b>.
