Many applications in computer vision and computer graphics require the
definition of curves and surfaces. Implicit surfaces are a popular
choice for this because they are smooth, can be appropriately
constrained by known geometry, and require no special treatment for
topology changes. In this paper we use Gaussian processes for this and
derive a covariance function  equivalent to the thin plate spline
regularizer which has desirable properties for shape modelling. We
demonstrate our approach for both 2D curves and 3D surfaces. The benefit
of using a Gaussian process for this is the meaningful probabilistic
representation of the function.
