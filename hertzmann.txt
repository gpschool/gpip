Computer animation is an extraordinarily labor-intensive process;
obtaining high-quality motion models could make the process faster and
easier.  I will describe methods for learning models of human poses
and motion from motion capture data.  I will begin with a pose model
based on the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM), and the
application of this model to Inverse Kinematics posing.  I will then
describe the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) for modeling
motion dynamics.  I may also mention a few other extensions to the
GPLVM for modeling motion data.  I will discuss the properties of
these models (both good and bad) and potential directions for future
work.
