Gaussian Processes in Practice</h2>
</center><hr><p>There has been a recent upsurge in interest
in Gaussian processes for solving a variety of machine learning
problems. Simultaneously there have been recent rapid developments in
efficient approximation techniques for Gaussian processes and novel
unifying theories of existing approximation techniques.

<p>This workshop will bring experts in Gaussian processes together
with individuals who are using Gaussian processes at the forefront of
research in their fields. We will start with a set of talks that will
relate the latest developments in Gaussian processes (speakers include
Chris Williams, Carl Rasmussen, David MacKay and Ed Snelson) while the
second portion of talks will discuss application fields where Gaussian
processes are being applied as state-of-the-art technologies: Robotics,
Graphics and Vision (speakers include Dieter Fox, Aaron Hertzmann and
Raquel Urtasun).

<p>We expect attendees at the workshop who are expert in Gaussian
processes as well as attendees who are interested in finding out about
Gaussian processes. The workshop is expected to be an ideal entry
point to a researcher interested in using these models, but at the
same time, by bringing together acknowledged experts in Gaussian
processes with acknowledged experts in the application areas mentioned
above we expect to drive forward research in novel directions.

<p>The workshop is sponsored by <a href="http://www.pascal-network.org">EU FP6 PASCAL Network of Excellence</a>.<p>The workshop is co-organised by: <li><a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~neil/">Neil D.

<hr><h2>By Rail</h2><p><p>The nearest railway station is Bletchley Railway Station in Milton Keynes. Bletchley Park is 300 yards walk from the railway station.

<p>There is a fast efficient service to Bletchley Railway Station from many stations in the U.K.. Check the <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk">national rail enquiries</a> site for details. 

<p>The live departures board for Bletchley Railway Station is available <a href="http://www.livedepartureboards.co.uk/ldb/summary.aspx?T=BLY">here</a><hr><h2>By Air</h2><p><h3>Birmingham</h3>
<p>There is a direct train to Bletchley Park from Birmingham International Airport, it takes about an hour.

<h3>Other Airports</h3>

It is also possible to take the train from other U.K. airports (Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester, Luton, Stansted). However, in each case the journey is over two hours. <h1>Accommodation</h1><p>Unfortunately there is no accommodation on site at Bletchley Park. However they have recommended local hotels for which a pick-up and drop off service can be provided.<h1>Conference Schedule</h1>
